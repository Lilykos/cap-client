## Introduction

The **CAP-Client** is a command-line application for the [CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP)](https://analysispreservation.cern.ch) API. It is a tool that facilitates preservation of physics data analyses, by allowing analysts to capture and store their analysis resources. The CAP-client is a free and open source project developed at [CERN](https://home.cern).

CAP-Client is complementary to the CERN Analysis Preservation project, and you can find more on the related documentation:
