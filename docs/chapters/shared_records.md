# Shared records

You can get one or all the shared records only if you have at least read access to it. You need to specify:

`--pid  the PID of the shared analysis you want to fetch`

`--all  flag to fetch all the shared analysis you have access to`

    $ cap-client get-shared --all

    $ cap-client get-shared --pid 1
